## Logic:
## Cards:
Make two variables that have lists assigned to them, one being value and one being suits
Then to make cards add each element of the value array to each of the suits
Those are your cards that make up the deck

## Deck:
Holds the cards, basically I think you just need to assign it a numeric value, so that you can say if you want to play with 1 or 2 decks (or more)
Should the shuffle function be in this class?

## Players
Signifies the number of players
Default 2 players, one is the computer/terminal and the other is the user
So I guess in theory you could name them: 'Dealer' & 'Player' 
OR if you didn't want the temrinal to play you could assign 'Player 1' & 'Player 2' and have people play against eachother
If Dealer + Player, assign an input to Player value for the terminal to take someone's name
